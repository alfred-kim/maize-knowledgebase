# Maize Stem Maggots (Atherigona spp.)

**Common name:** Maize stem maggots  
**Scientific name:** *Atherigona* species (commonly *Atherigona soccata*, *Atherigona orientalis*)  
**Importance:** Early-season pest causing seedling death and deadheart; can severely reduce plant stands and yield.

---

## Identification
- **Larvae (maggots):** Small, whitish to yellowish, legless, cylindrical; **5–8 mm** long; found inside young stems or leaf whorls.  
- **Adults:** Small grayish flies with yellow abdomen; resemble small houseflies; **3–5 mm** long.  
- **Pupae:** Brown, oval, found inside the stem or at the base of the plant.

---

## Symptoms / Damage
- **Deadheart** in young maize (central whorl dries and can be pulled out easily).  
- Wilting of central leaves while outer leaves remain green.  
- Poor plant vigor and stunted growth.  
- Reduced plant population and uneven stands.  
- Maggots found inside the whorl or tunneling the stem base.

---

## Life cycle (brief)
- **Egg → Larva → Pupa → Adult**.  
- Eggs laid on the underside of leaves near the central whorl.  
- Larvae crawl into the whorl and tunnel into the stem.  
- Pupation occurs inside the damaged stem or soil surface.  
- Multiple generations occur per season, especially in warm, humid conditions.

---

## Monitoring & Scouting
- Check seedlings **1–3 weeks after emergence** for deadheart symptoms.  
- Look for drying central leaves or pulled-out whorl leaves.  
- Count affected plants and estimate percentage infestation per field.  
- Monitor for adult flies early in the morning around young plants.

## Integrated Pest Management (IPM)

### Cultural control
- Plant early so that seedlings establish before fly populations peak.  
- Use high seed rates and thin later if necessary in high-risk areas.  
- Apply recommended fertilizer to strengthen early plant growth.  
- Avoid consecutive maize cropping; rotate with legumes.  
- Destroy infested crop residues to reduce breeding sites.

### Biological control
- Predators: spiders and small wasps can reduce adult fly numbers.  
- Parasitic wasps (e.g., *Aphaereta* spp.) may attack larvae in some regions.

### Chemical control (if necessary)
- Treat seeds with systemic insecticides where permitted (e.g., imidacloprid-based seed dressing).  
- Apply **early foliar sprays** targeting adult flies soon after crop emergence (pyrethroids).  
- Ensure correct timing — sprays are ineffective once maggots enter the stem.  
- Always follow label instructions and wear proper PPE.

### Resistance management
- Avoid overuse of any single insecticide class.  
- Combine cultural controls with targeted chemical use.  
- Monitor fields for reduced sensitivity.

## Safety & environmental notes
- Use PPE when handling seed treatments or insecticides.  
- Avoid spraying near water bodies and beneficial insect habitats.  
- Dispose of pesticide containers safely according to regulations.

---

## Record keeping
- Record number of seedlings affected, timing of infestation, and treatments applied.  
- Helps refine planting time and control strategies for future seasons.
