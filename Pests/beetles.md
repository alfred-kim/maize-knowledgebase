# Beetles (Scarabaeidae, Chrysomelidae, Curculionidae, Elateridae)

**Common name:** Beetles (grubs, leaf beetles, weevils, wireworms)  
**Scientific groups:**  
- Scarab beetles – *Scarabaeidae*  
- Leaf beetles – *Chrysomelidae*  
- Weevils – *Curculionidae*  
- Click beetles (wireworms) – *Elateridae*  

**Importance:** Beetles are major pests at both **larval and adult stages**, attacking roots, stems, leaves, and stored grains. Root-feeding larvae (grubs, wireworms) can severely reduce crop establishment and vigor, while adults of some species cause foliar damage or grain loss.

## Identification

- **Larvae:**  
  - **Scarab grubs:** C-shaped, creamy white, brown head; found in soil.  
  - **Leaf beetle larvae:** Soft-bodied, elongate; may have stripes or spots.  
  - **Wireworms:** Hard, slender, yellow–brown; feed on seeds and roots.  
  - **Weevil larvae:** White, legless, typically inside stems or grains.

- **Adults:**  
  - Hard-bodied insects with **elytra** (wing covers).  
  - Size: **2–25 mm** depending on species.  
  - **Leaf beetles** often brightly colored.  
  - **Weevils** have a characteristic **snout**.  
  - **Scarab beetles** robust, sometimes metallic.

## Symptoms / Damage

- **Root feeding:** Stunting, wilting, poor crop establishment (grubs, wireworms).  
- **Leaf feeding:** Holes, skeletonization, or windowpane feeding (leaf beetles).  
- **Stem damage:** Boring or tunneling by some weevil species.  
- **Seed/grain damage:** Holes and powder from grain weevils.  
- Patchy emergence patterns due to soil-dwelling larvae.

## Life cycle (brief)

- **Egg → Larva → Pupa → Adult** (complete metamorphosis).  
- Eggs often deposited in soil or on plant surfaces.  
- Larvae may stay in soil for **weeks to years** depending on species.  
- Adults may have **1–3 generations** per year.

## Monitoring & Scouting

- Conduct **soil sampling** before planting to detect grubs and wireworms.  
- Check seedlings for missing plants, wilting, or leaf feeding.  
- Look for adults on leaves and stems.  
- Use **light traps** or **pheromone traps** where applicable.  
- Inspect stored grain for weevil adults or holes in kernels.

## Integrated Pest Management (IPM)

### Cultural control
- Rotate with non-host crops.  
- Deep ploughing to expose larvae and pupae.  
- Maintain clean storage facilities to prevent grain infestations.  
- Remove volunteer plants and weed hosts.  
- Early planting to escape peak beetle activity.

### Biological control
- Predators: ground beetles, birds, ants.  
- Fungal pathogens: *Beauveria bassiana*, *Metarhizium anisopliae*.  
- Beneficial nematodes: *Steinernema* and *Heterorhabditis* spp.  
- Parasitoids for certain leaf beetles and weevils.

### Chemical control (if necessary)
- **Soil insecticides** for grubs and wireworms at planting.  
- **Foliar sprays** for leaf beetles on seedlings.  
- Grain protectants or fumigation for storage pests.  
- Effective active ingredients:  
  - Pyrethroids  
  - Neonicotinoids  
  - Organophosphates  
- Follow label instructions and apply responsibly.

### Resistance management
- Rotate insecticides by **mode of action**.  
- Combine cultural and biological strategies to reduce chemical dependence.

## Safety & environmental notes
- Wear PPE when applying pesticides.  
- Avoid spraying flowering crops to protect pollinators.  
- Prevent contamination of soil and water sources.  
- Dispose of pesticide containers safely.

---

## Record keeping
- Record soil pest levels, adult beetle counts, and crop damage.  
- Keep logs of pesticide applications and efficacy.  
- Track storage pest inspections for grain weevils.
