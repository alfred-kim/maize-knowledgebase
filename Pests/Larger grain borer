# Larger Grain Borer (Prostephanus truncatus)

**Common name:** Larger grain borer (LGB)  
**Scientific name:** *Prostephanus truncatus*  
**Importance:** Major post-harvest pest of stored maize and dried cassava; causes severe quantitative and qualitative losses.

---

## Identification
- **Adults:** Cylindrical, reddish-brown to dark brown beetles; **3–4.5 mm** long; head concealed by pronotum.  
- **Larvae:** White, C-shaped grubs with brown head capsule; found inside grain feeding.  
- **Damage signs:** Characteristic fine powdery dust (frass) and large perforations in maize cobs or stored grain.

---

## Symptoms / Damage
- Extensive boring inside stored maize kernels and cobs.  
- Grain reduced to fine dust, leading to weight loss up to **30–80%** in severe infestations.  
- Increased grain temperature and moisture due to respiration → promotes mold growth.  
- Holes and tunnels weaken grain integrity, reducing market and seed quality.

---

## Life cycle (brief)
- **Egg → Larva → Pupa → Adult**.  
- Females lay eggs inside grain kernels.  
- Larvae develop and feed within the grain.  
- Pupation occurs inside kernels.  
- Lifecycle length: **25–35 days** in warm, humid conditions → multiple generations per year.

---

## Monitoring & Scouting
- Inspect stored maize for **powdery dust**, perforations, and live adults.  
- Use **pheromone traps** to detect early infestations.  
- Monitor storage structures, bags, and drying facilities before loading new grain.  
- Record temperature and moisture levels (high moisture increases infestation risk).

## Integrated Pest Management (IPM)

### Cultural control
- Dry maize thoroughly to **≤ 13% moisture** before storage.  
- Shell maize fully and clean stores before filling.  
- Use rodent-proof, airtight, and moisture-proof storage systems (e.g., hermetic bags, metal silos).  
- Practice **first-in, first-out** storage rotation.

### Biological control
- Predatory beetle *Teretriosoma nigrescens* can suppress LGB populations in some regions.  
- Encouraging natural enemies by minimizing unnecessary insecticide use.

### Chemical control (if necessary)
- **Grain protectants**: e.g., Pirimiphos-methyl (Actellic), deltamethrin-based dusts.  
- **Fumigation**: Phosphine tablets (applied by trained personnel only).  
- Never apply fumigants inside homes or unventilated spaces.  
- Always follow label instructions and wear proper PPE.

### Resistance management
- Avoid repeated fumigation with the same active ingredient.  
- Combine hermetic storage with limited, well-timed chemical use.  
- Rotate chemical classes where applicable.

## Safety & environmental notes
- Use PPE when mixing or applying chemicals.  
- Ensure proper ventilation during and after fumigation.  
- Keep chemicals away from food, water, and living areas.  
- Dispose of pesticide containers safely.

---

## Record keeping
- Document dates of drying, storage, treatments, and infestation levels.  
- Helps track treatment effectiveness and prevent future losses.

- Local extension bulletins on post-harvest management.  
- FAO guidelines on stored product pest control.
