# Black Maize Beetle (Heteronychus arator)

**Common name:** Black maize beetle / African black beetle  
**Scientific name:** *Heteronychus arator*  

**Importance:**  
A destructive soil pest of maize, sorghum, sugarcane, and various grasses. Adults feed on underground stems and roots, cutting young plants at or just below soil level. Severe infestations can cause poor establishment, gaps in rows, and major stand loss.

## Identification

### Adult beetles
- Shiny jet-black, hard-bodied beetles.  
- Size: **10–14 mm** long.  
- Cylindrical body, strong mandibles for chewing stems.  
- Slow-moving; hide in the soil during the day and feed at night.

### Larvae (grubs)
- Typical scarab “C-shaped” white grubs.  
- Brown head capsule, 3 pairs of legs.  
- Found in soil feeding on roots and organic matter.

## Symptoms / Damage
- Seedlings cut at or just below the soil surface.  
- Missing or wilted plants in patches.  
- Plants pull out easily due to root damage.  
- Reduced plant populations → significant yield loss.  
- In older plants: stunted growth, weak anchorage, and poor vigor.

---

## Life Cycle (brief)
- **Egg → Larva (3 instars) → Pupa → Adult**  
- Adults emerge with onset of rains.  
- Females lay eggs in moist soil.  
- Larvae develop in soil, feeding on roots and decomposing material.  
- Adults cause the most visible crop damage by cutting seedlings.

## Monitoring & Scouting
- Inspect missing or freshly cut seedlings.  
- Dig around damaged plants to find beetles hiding in soil.  
- Use pitfall traps to monitor adult activity at night.  
- Check grassy field borders—beetles breed in grassland soils.  
- Scouting is most important from **emergence to V6**.

## Integrated Pest Management (IPM)

### Cultural control
- Deep ploughing to expose beetles and grubs to predators.  
- Destroy grasses and sod cover before planting.  
- Rotate crops with non-hosts where feasible.  
- Plant early to ensure rapid crop establishment.  
- Avoid planting maize immediately after pasture or fallow grass fields.

### Biological control
- Natural predators: birds, ground beetles, ants.  
- Entomopathogenic fungi (*Metarhizium anisopliae*, *Beauveria bassiana*) effective in moist soils.  
- Nematodes (*Heterorhabditis*, *Steinernema*) may suppress larvae.

### Chemical control (if necessary)
- Seed treatments using systemic insecticides:  
  - Imidacloprid  
  - Thiamethoxam  
  - Clothianidin  
- Soil-applied granules or in-furrow treatments at planting.  
- Rescue sprays are **ineffective** because adults feed underground.

### Resistance management
- Rotate insecticide modes of action.  
- Avoid relying solely on neonicotinoid seed treatments.  
- Combine cultural, biological, and chemical approaches.

## Safety & Environmental Notes
- Use PPE when handling soil insecticides.  
- Avoid contaminating water sources with granules or drenches.  
- Insecticides in soil can affect beneficial soil organisms; use only when necessary.  
- Follow local regulations and product label instructions.

---

## Record Keeping
- Track stand losses, plant populations, and patchy emergence.  
- Record field history: previous pasture, grass cover, and beetle presence.  
- Note effectiveness of seed treatments or soil management practices.
