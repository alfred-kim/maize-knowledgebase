# Angoumois Grain Moth (Sitotroga cerealella)

**Common name:** Angoumois grain moth  
**Scientific name:** *Sitotroga cerealella*  
**Importance:** Serious pest of stored grains (especially maize, wheat, rice, sorghum); larvae feed inside kernels, reducing weight and seed viability.

---

## Identification
- **Adults:** Small, yellowish to pale straw-colored moths; narrow fringed wings; **6–10 mm** wingspan.  
- **Larvae:** Creamy-white caterpillars with brown head capsule; develop inside grain kernels.  
- **Pupae:** Form inside the hollowed kernel, often with a visible “window” where the adult later exits.

---

## Symptoms / Damage
- Small round exit holes in grains caused by adult moth emergence.  
- Powdery frass inside kernels.  
- Weight loss due to internal feeding.  
- Reduced germination and poor seed viability.  
- Infestations often begin in the field and continue into storage.

---

## Life cycle (brief)
- **Egg → Larva → Pupa → Adult**.  
- Eggs laid on grains in the field or in storage.  
- Larvae burrow into kernels and feed internally.  
- Pupation occurs inside the same grain.  
- Development takes **30–45 days**, faster under warm conditions → multiple generations per year.

---

## Monitoring & Scouting
- Inspect stored grain for **exit holes** and dust-like frass.  
- Use **pheromone traps** to detect adult moth activity.  
- Check both field-stored cobs and shelled grain before storage.  
- Monitor grain moisture and temperature regularly.

## Integrated Pest Management (IPM)

### Cultural control
- Harvest promptly to reduce field infestation.  
- Dry grain to **≤ 13% moisture** before storage.  
- Ensure clean stores, bags, and equipment before loading new grain.  
- Use hermetic storage (e.g., PICS bags, metal silos) to limit oxygen and suppress moth development.

### Biological control
- Parasitoids such as *Trichogramma* spp. may attack eggs.  
- Predatory insects in storage can help reduce moth populations.  
- Preserve beneficials by limiting unnecessary chemical treatments.

### Chemical control (if necessary)
- **Grain protectants**: pyrimiphos-methyl, deltamethrin, or permethrin-based products where permitted.  
- **Fumigation** with phosphine for high infestations (trained personnel only).  
- Avoid applying insecticides on grain intended for seed unless specifically labeled.

### Resistance management
- Rotate insecticides with different **modes of action**.  
- Combine hermetic storage with limited chemical intervention.  
- Avoid repeated fumigations that may promote resistance.

## Safety & environmental notes
- Wear PPE when handling insecticides or fumigants.  
- Ensure good ventilation during fumigation.  
- Keep chemicals away from food, drinking water, and living spaces.  
- Dispose of used containers responsibly.

---

## Record keeping
- Track harvest dates, moisture content, storage treatments, and moth activity.  
- Evaluate control effectiveness and improve future storage practices.
