# Leaf Beetles (Chrysomelidae)

**Common name:** Leaf beetles  
**Scientific name:** Various species within the family *Chrysomelidae*  
**Importance:** Important foliar-feeding pests; larvae and adults feed on leaves, stems, and sometimes roots, reducing plant vigor and yield.

---

## Identification
- **Larvae:** Soft-bodied, elongated or grub-like, often dark or yellowish; some species have visible tubercles or spines.  
- **Adults:** Typically oval, convex beetles; brightly colored or metallic in many species; size ranges **2–12 mm** depending on species.  
- Often found on the undersides of leaves or feeding along leaf margins.

---

## Symptoms / Damage
- **Leaf chewing**, resulting in holes, windowing, or full-thickness defoliation.  
- Skeletonization of leaves where only veins remain.  
- Reduced photosynthesis and stunted growth under heavy infestation.  
- Some species feed on flowers or developing pods, further affecting yield.

---

## Life cycle (brief)
- **Egg → Larva → Pupa → Adult**.  
- Eggs often laid on leaf surfaces or stems in clusters.  
- Larvae feed actively on foliage or sometimes roots (species-dependent).  
- Pupation may occur in soil or on the plant.  
- Multiple generations possible per season in warm climates.

---

## Monitoring & Scouting
- Check **undersides of leaves** for eggs, larvae, and adult clusters.  
- Look for leaf windowing and edge feeding.  
- Use **visual counts** or sweep nets in crops with heavy foliage.  
- Assess crop growth stage and damage level to determine thresholds.

## Integrated Pest Management (IPM)

### Cultural control
- Early planting to allow crops to establish before peak beetle emergence.  
- Remove weeds that serve as alternative hosts.  
- Deep tillage to expose overwintering larvae and pupae in soil.  
- Use resistant varieties where available.

### Biological control
- **Predators:** lady beetles, lacewings, ground beetles, and spiders.  
- **Parasitoids:** tachinid flies and parasitic wasps attack larvae.  
- **Pathogens:** entomopathogenic fungi (*Beauveria*, *Metarhizium*) effective in moist conditions.

### Chemical control (if necessary)
- Foliar sprays of **pyrethroids** (e.g., Cypermethrin, Deltamethrin) or **neonicotinoids** (e.g., Imidacloprid) when populations exceed thresholds.  
- Target **young larvae**, which are more susceptible than adults.  
- Follow all label instructions and wear proper PPE.

### Resistance management
- Rotate insecticides with different **modes of action**.  
- Avoid repeated spraying of the same chemical group.  
- Combine chemical, cultural, and biological methods to slow resistance development.

## Safety & environmental notes
- Use PPE during mixing and spraying.  
- Prevent drift into water bodies and pollinator habitats.  
- Dispose of empty containers and leftover chemicals safely.

---

## Record keeping
- Record beetle counts, crop growth stage, feeding damage, and control measures used.  
- Helps refine management strategies across seasons.
