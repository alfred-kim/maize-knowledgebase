# Thrips (Thrips tabaci and other species)

**Common name:** Thrips  
**Scientific name:** *Thrips tabaci* (common maize thrips)  
**Importance:** Sap-sucking pest of maize; can cause leaf damage, stunted growth, and virus transmission.

---

## Identification
- Tiny, slender insects, 1–2 mm long.  
- Color: yellow, brown, or dark depending on species and stage.  
- Found on the underside of young leaves and in leaf whorls.  
- Adults have fringed wings and move quickly when disturbed.

---

## Symptoms / Damage
- Silvering or streaking on leaves due to sap-sucking.  
- Leaf curling and distortion.  
- Stunted growth in severe infestations.  
- Can transmit viruses such as Maize rough dwarf virus.  
- Black fecal spots may be visible on leaves.

---

## Life cycle (brief)
- Egg → Nymph (2–3 instars) → Pupa → Adult.  
- Rapid reproduction under warm conditions; several generations per season.  
- Thrips often hide in leaf whorls, making early detection important.

---

## Monitoring & Scouting
- Inspect young leaves and whorls for thrips.  
- Look for silver streaks, curling, or black fecal spots.  
- Record the number of insects per plant and plant damage levels.

## Integrated Pest Management (IPM)

### Cultural control
- Plant resistant varieties if available.  
- Remove crop residues after harvest to reduce overwintering sites.  
- Avoid excessive nitrogen fertilization, which can favor thrips outbreaks.

### Biological control
- Predators: minute pirate bugs, ladybirds, predatory mites.  
- Encourage natural enemy habitats in and around maize fields.

### Chemical control (if necessary)
- Neonicotinoids: Acetamiprid, Imidacloprid  
- Diamides (limited efficacy): Chlorantraniliprole  
- Apply targeting young larvae in whorls; follow label instructions and safety measures.  

### Resistance management
- Rotate chemical groups to prevent resistance.  
- Integrate chemical treatment with cultural and biological controls.

## Safety & environmental notes
- Wear PPE when handling insecticides.  
- Avoid spraying near water sources or pollinator habitats.  
- Dispose of containers and leftover chemicals properly.  

---

## Record keeping
- Maintain records of scouting, infestation levels, and treatments applied.  
- Helps improve future pest management strategies.

- Local agricultural extension service guidance.  
- FAO/IPM manuals on maize thrips management.
