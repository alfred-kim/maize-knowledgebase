# Cutworms (Agrotis spp.)

**Common name:** Cutworms  
**Scientific name:** *Agrotis* species  
**Importance:** Major soil-surface pest; attacks young maize seedlings by cutting stems at or near the soil level.

---

## Identification
- Larvae: Smooth, cylindrical caterpillars, usually grey, brown, or black, 2–5 cm long.  
- Adults: Moths, nocturnal, dull-colored, wingspan ~3–5 cm.  
- Larvae curl into a “C” shape when disturbed.  

---

## Symptoms / Damage
- Seedlings cut at soil level, causing plant death.  
- Wilting or missing seedlings in patches.  
- Damage usually occurs at night when larvae are feeding.  
- Can affect germination if infestation is severe.

---

## Life cycle (brief)
- Egg → Larva (5–6 instars) → Pupa → Adult moth.  
- Larvae feed on seedlings and small plants, often at night.  
- Pupation occurs in the soil; several generations per year in warm climates.

---

## Monitoring & Scouting
- Inspect seedlings at night using a flashlight.  
- Look for cut plants and larvae hiding in soil near stem base.  
- Monitor early planting fields, as cutworms target young seedlings.

## Integrated Pest Management (IPM)

### Cultural control
- Deep ploughing before planting to expose pupae to predators.  
- Remove weeds and crop residues to reduce shelter and food for larvae.  
- Use clean, healthy seedbeds to reduce pest pressure.  
- Adjust planting dates to avoid peak cutworm activity.

### Biological control
- Encourage natural predators: birds, ants, beetles, and parasitic wasps.  
- Nematodes and entomopathogenic fungi can reduce larval populations.

### Chemical control (if necessary)
- Apply selective soil insecticides such as:  
  - Pyrethroids: Cypermethrin, Deltamethrin  
  - Organophosphates: Chlorpyrifos  
- Apply to soil near seedlings following label instructions and safety measures.

### Resistance management
- Rotate chemical groups to prevent resistance development.  
- Combine chemical treatments with cultural and biological controls.

## Safety & environmental notes
- Wear personal protective equipment (PPE) when applying chemicals.  
- Avoid contamination of water and non-target organisms.  
- Follow label instructions and disposal guidelines.

---

## Record keeping
- Keep records of field scouting, cutworm incidence, and control measures applied.  
- Helps inform future planting and pest management strategies.
