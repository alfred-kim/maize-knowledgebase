# Earworms (Helicoverpa spp.)

**Common name:** Earworms  
**Scientific names (examples):**  
- Maize/Corn earworm – *Helicoverpa zea*  
- African bollworm – *Helicoverpa armigera*  

**Importance:**  
Major pests of maize, sorghum, legumes, cotton, and vegetables. Larvae attack maize silks and ears, causing direct kernel damage, entry points for fungal infection, and reduced grain quality. Highly mobile moths and multiple generations make control challenging.

## Identification
- **Larvae:**  
  - Smooth-bodied caterpillars with stripes; color varies from green to brown to nearly black.  
  - Distinct pale and dark longitudinal stripes.  
  - Length **up to 30–40 mm** when mature.  
  - Head capsule usually brown.  
- **Adults:**  
  - Light brown to tan moths with a wingspan of **30–40 mm**.  
  - Forewings mottled; hindwings pale with a dark margin.  
- **Eggs:** Cream-colored, dome-shaped eggs laid singly on fresh maize silks or tender leaves.

## Symptoms / Damage
- Feeding on **maize silks**, reducing pollination and kernel set.  
- Entry of larvae into the ear tip, where they feed on developing kernels.  
- Presence of frass (sawdust-like excreta) inside the ear.  
- Damaged tips encourage mold, *Aspergillus*, and secondary pests.  
- Beans, tomatoes, and cotton may show holes and internal feeding.  
- Usually **one larva per ear** due to cannibalism.

---

## Life cycle (brief)
- **Egg → Larva → Pupa → Adult**.  
- Eggs hatch in 2–5 days.  
- Larvae feed for 2–3 weeks before pupating in soil.  
- Adults emerge after 7–14 days depending on temperature.  
- Multiple generations per year (up to 4–6 in warm regions).  
- Moth migration influences seasonal outbreaks.

---

## Monitoring & Scouting
- Inspect maize **silks**, especially fresh silks during flowering.  
- Look for eggs on silks and small larvae in the ear tip.  
- Use pheromone traps or light traps to monitor adult moth flights.  
- Sample at least 10–20 plants per field section.  
- Peak risk occurs during early silk emergence.

## Integrated Pest Management (IPM)

### Cultural control
- Plant early to avoid peak moth periods.  
- Maintain good crop rotation and avoid continuous maize.  
- Destroy crop residues to reduce overwintering pupae.  
- Use resistant/tolerant maize varieties where available.  

### Biological control
- Egg parasitoids such as *Trichogramma* spp. can suppress populations.  
- Larval parasitoids (*Cotesia*, *Microplitis* spp.) and predators (lady beetles, lacewings).  
- *Helicoverpa* NPV (nucleopolyhedrovirus) effective on young larvae.  
- Bt maize and Bt sprays (*Bacillus thuringiensis*) effective on early instars.

### Chemical control (if necessary)
- Spray when **eggs are present** or larvae are still feeding on silks before entering the ear.  
- Effective insecticides include:  
  - Pyrethroids (cypermethrin, lambda-cyhalothrin)  
  - Spinosyns (spinosad, spinetoram)  
  - Diamides (chlorantraniliprole, flubendiamide)  
  - Carbamates and organophosphates (use with caution)  
- Ensure good coverage of **silks**.  
- Once larvae enter the ear, control becomes difficult.

### Resistance management
- Rotate insecticides across different **modes of action**.  
- Avoid repeated use of pyrethroids alone.  
- Integrate biological and cultural measures with chemicals.  
- For Bt maize, follow refuge requirements.

## Safety & environmental notes
- Wear PPE during insecticide use.  
- Avoid spraying during bee-active hours (silking attracts pollinators).  
- Prevent runoff into water bodies.  

---

## Record keeping
- Track pheromone trap catches, silk infestation levels, and treatments.  
- Note seasonal patterns to anticipate future outbreaks.
