# Whiteflies (Bemisia tabaci)

**Common name:** Whiteflies  
**Scientific name:** *Bemisia tabaci*  
**Importance:** Sap-sucking pest; causes yellowing, stunting, and transmits viral diseases in maize.

---

## Identification
- Tiny, winged insects, ~1–2 mm long.  
- Color: white adults with powdery wings.  
- Nymphs are small, flat, and pale, usually on the underside of leaves.  
- Excrete honeydew, which can lead to sooty mold growth.

---

## Symptoms / Damage
- Yellowing or chlorosis of leaves.  
- Leaf curling, stunted growth, and reduced vigor.  
- Honeydew deposition leading to sooty mold.  
- Can transmit viruses such as Maize streak virus (MSV).  
- Severe infestations can reduce yield and quality.

---

## Life cycle (brief)
- Egg → Nymph (4 instars) → Pupa → Adult.  
- Adults are highly mobile and can disperse to other plants.  
- Several generations per season under warm, favorable conditions.

---

## Monitoring & Scouting
- Inspect undersides of leaves for adults, nymphs, and honeydew.  
- Record the number of insects per plant or per leaf.  
- Note signs of virus transmission and plant yellowing.

## Integrated Pest Management (IPM)

### Cultural control
- Remove and destroy crop residues after harvest.  
- Plant resistant or tolerant maize varieties where available.  
- Avoid dense planting that favors humidity and pest buildup.  
- Encourage plant diversity and natural habitats for predators.

### Biological control
- Predators: ladybirds, lacewings, predatory beetles, spiders.  
- Parasitoids: *Encarsia* spp. and *Eretmocerus* spp. attack nymphs.  
- Encourage conservation of natural enemies.

### Chemical control (if necessary)
- Neonicotinoids: Imidacloprid, Thiamethoxam  
- Pyrethroids: Lambda-cyhalothrin, Deltamethrin (less effective, resistance common)  
- Apply to undersides of leaves where adults and nymphs feed.  
- Follow label instructions, pre-harvest intervals, and PPE guidelines.

### Resistance management
- Rotate insecticide modes of action (MOA).  
- Combine chemical treatments with cultural and biological measures.

## Safety & environmental notes
- Wear PPE when applying chemicals.  
- Avoid contamination of water sources.  
- Protect pollinators and beneficial insects wherever possible.  
- Properly dispose of containers and leftover chemicals.

---

## Record keeping
- Keep logs of infestation levels, scouting dates, and treatments applied.  
- Helps track trends and improve future management strategies.
