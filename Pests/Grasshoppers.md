# Grasshoppers (Acrididae family)

**Common name:** Grasshoppers  
**Scientific name:** Various species within the family *Acrididae*  
**Importance:** Major foliar-feeding pests; nymphs and adults feed on a wide range of crops, causing defoliation and significant yield loss under outbreak conditions.

---

## Identification
- **Nymphs:** Wingless, smaller versions of adults; undergo several molts (instars).  
- **Adults:** Typically green, brown, or yellowish; strong hind legs for jumping; two pairs of wings with hindwings sometimes brightly colored.  
- Size varies by species, generally **2–7 cm** long.  
- Found in grasslands, croplands, and field margins.

---

## Symptoms / Damage
- Irregular leaf defoliation with ragged edges.  
- Stripping of leaves, stems, and in severe infestations even bark or developing grains.  
- Reduced photosynthesis leading to stunted growth and lower yields.  
- Damage often starts at field edges and progresses inward.

---

## Life cycle (brief)
- **Egg → Nymph → Adult**.  
- Eggs laid in soil in pods during dry conditions.  
- Nymphs hatch with onset of rains and feed immediately.  
- Several nymphal instars before becoming adults.  
- One or more generations per year depending on species and climate.

---

## Monitoring & Scouting
- Conduct **field-edge surveys** where populations often begin.  
- Use **sweep nets** or visual counts to estimate nymph and adult density.  
- Record **defoliation level**, crop stage, and distribution of infestation.  
- Pay attention to weather conditions favoring outbreaks (dry spells followed by rains).

## Integrated Pest Management (IPM)

### Cultural control
- Maintain early planting to reduce vulnerability during peak grasshopper emergence.  
- **Field sanitation:** remove weeds and grasses that harbor eggs and early nymphs.  
- Deep tillage during dry season to expose egg pods.  
- Maintain vegetation barriers or trap crops in field margins if feasible.

### Biological control
- **Pathogens:** *Metarhizium anisopliae* and *Beauveria bassiana* fungi effective against nymphs.  
- **Predators:** birds, spiders, ground beetles, and parasitic wasps naturally suppress populations.  
- Encourage habitat for natural enemies by reducing indiscriminate pesticide use.

### Chemical control (if necessary)
- Use **contact or stomach insecticides** when thresholds are exceeded: Pyrethroids (e.g., Cypermethrin, Deltamethrin), Organophosphates (e.g., Malathion).  
- Target **early nymphal stages** for best effectiveness.  
- Apply according to label instructions and ensure proper PPE.  
- Avoid spraying during windy conditions to reduce drift.

### Resistance management
- Rotate active ingredients (different **modes of action**).  
- Combine chemical, cultural, and biological methods to reduce resistance development.

## Safety & environmental notes
- Wear full PPE when handling and applying pesticides.  
- Protect water sources and avoid spraying near pollinator habitats.  
- Safely dispose of containers and leftover chemicals following guidelines.

---

## Record keeping
- Document grasshopper counts, crop stage, weather, damage levels, and actions taken.  
- Helps improve forecasting and management decisions in future seasons.
