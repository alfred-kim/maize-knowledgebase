# Sawtoothed Grain Beetle (Oryzaephilus surinamensis)

**Common name:** Sawtoothed grain beetle  
**Scientific name:** *Oryzaephilus surinamensis*  
**Importance:** Common secondary pest of stored grains and processed products; causes contamination and quality loss in maize, wheat, rice, flour, bran, dried fruits, and nuts.

---

## Identification
- **Adults:** Flat, slender, brown beetles; **2.5–3.5 mm** long.  
- Distinctive **six saw-like teeth** on each side of the pronotum (behind the head).  
- Cannot fly; moves quickly through cracks and stored grain.  
- **Larvae:** Creamy-white, elongated, with a brown head; up to **3 mm** long.

---

## Symptoms / Damage
- Infestation of grain dust, broken kernels, and processed foods.  
- Beetles do **not attack whole, intact grains**, but thrive on cracks, broken pieces, and residues.  
- Contamination with adults, larvae, frass, and cast skins.  
- Increased heating and moisture buildup can promote mold growth.  
- Loss of grain and product quality, making food unfit for sale or consumption.

---

## Life cycle (brief)
- **Egg → Larva → Pupa → Adult**.  
- Eggs laid among food particles and grain residues.  
- Larvae feed on broken grain and fine materials.  
- Development time: **20–40 days** depending on temperature and humidity.  
- Multiple overlapping generations; populations can explode in warm, humid stores.

---

## Monitoring & Scouting
- Inspect processed grain, broken kernels, and grain dust for larvae and adults.  
- Check **cracks, seams, and storage corners** where residues accumulate.  
- Use **pitfall traps** or sticky traps to detect adults.  
- Monitor product temperature and humidity.

## Integrated Pest Management (IPM)

### Cultural control
- Maintain strict **sanitation**: remove dust, broken grain, and spilled product.  
- Clean store rooms, bins, bag stacks, and mill equipment regularly.  
- Use **FIFO** (first-in, first-out) for all stored products.  
- Keep storage areas dry and cool to slow population growth.

### Biological control
- Some natural predators and parasitoids may reduce populations but are not adequate alone.  
- Avoid unnecessary pesticide use to preserve beneficial species.

### Chemical control (if necessary)
- Apply **contact insecticides** (e.g., pyrethroids) to empty stores, cracks, and machinery before loading grain.  
- **Phosphine fumigation** for severe infestations — trained applicators only.  
- Avoid direct contamination of food products; follow labeling strictly.

### Resistance management
- Rotate different **insecticide modes of action**.  
- Combine sanitation, structural treatments, and environmental control.  
- Avoid repeated reliance on fumigation.

## Safety & environmental notes
- Wear appropriate PPE during treatments.  
- Ensure good ventilation, especially during fumigation.  
- Store chemicals away from food, water, and living areas.  
- Dispose of containers responsibly.

---

## Record keeping
- Record trap counts, cleaning schedules, product treatments, and infestation hotspots.  
- Helps refine prevention and control strategies over time.
