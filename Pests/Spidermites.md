# Spider Mites (Tetranychidae)

**Common name:** Spider mites  
**Scientific names (examples):**  
- Two-spotted spider mite – *Tetranychus urticae*  
- Carmine spider mite – *Tetranychus cinnabarinus*  
- Red spider mite – *Oligonychus spp.*  

**Importance:**  
Major sap-sucking pests that damage maize, beans, vegetables, fruit trees, and many other crops. They thrive in hot, dry conditions. Feeding causes leaf discoloration, reduced photosynthesis, stunting, and yield loss. Severe infestations produce fine webbing and rapid plant decline.

---

## Identification
- **Adults:** Very small (0.3–0.5 mm), oval-shaped; usually yellow-green, red, or brown depending on species and season.  
- **Nymphs:** Similar to adults but smaller and paler.  
- **Eggs:** Spherical, translucent eggs laid on the underside of leaves.  
- Often found in colonies with characteristic **fine webbing** on the lower leaf surface.

---

## Symptoms / Damage
- Tiny yellow or white speckles (“stippling”) on leaves.  
- Leaf bronzing, yellowing, or drying as feeding intensity increases.  
- Fine webbing covering leaf surfaces in heavy infestations.  
- Reduced plant vigor and stunting.  
- Premature leaf drop under extreme conditions.  
- Damage worsens during **hot, dry weather**.

---

## Life cycle (brief)
- **Egg → Larva → Nymph → Adult**.  
- Very rapid development — life cycle completed in **7–14 days** depending on temperature.  
- High reproductive capacity; populations explode under warm, dry conditions.  
- Several overlapping generations per season.

---

## Monitoring & Scouting
- Regularly check the **underside of leaves** using a hand lens.  
- Look for stippling, discoloration, and early signs of webbing.  
- Focus on lower leaves and field edges where infestations often begin.  
- Dusty fields or drought-stressed plants are more prone to outbreaks.  
- Use yellow sticky cards to detect other small sucking pests that may co-occur.

## Integrated Pest Management (IPM)

### Cultural control
- Irrigate properly — avoid drought stress that favors spider mites.  
- Reduce dust by watering roads/paths if possible; dust encourages mite outbreaks.  
- Maintain weed control since many weed hosts harbor mites.  
- Avoid unnecessary use of broad-spectrum insecticides (which kill natural predators).

### Biological control
- Predatory mites (e.g., *Phytoseiulus persimilis*, *Amblyseius* spp.) are highly effective.  
- Predatory insects such as lady beetles, minute pirate bugs, and lacewing larvae help suppress populations.  
- Entomopathogenic fungi (*Beauveria bassiana*, *Metarhizium anisopliae*) perform well in humid conditions.

### Chemical control (if necessary)
- Use **selective miticides** rather than broad-spectrum insecticides.  
- Effective active ingredients include:  
  - Abamectin  
  - Spiromesifen  
  - Bifenazate  
  - Hexythiazox (ovicide/larvicide)  
  - Fenpyroximate  
- Apply miticides early when populations are low.  
- Ensure thorough coverage of the **undersides** of leaves.  
- Rotate miticides with different modes of action to delay resistance.

### Resistance management
- Spider mites develop resistance quickly — avoid repeated use of the same miticide.  
- Combine chemical control with biological and cultural methods.  
- Use threshold-based spraying only when necessary.

## Safety & environmental notes
- Wear PPE when applying miticides.  
- Avoid drift into water bodies.  
- Miticides can be harmful to beneficial mites if overused — apply carefully.  
- Dispose of containers according to local regulations.

---

## Record keeping
- Record mite counts, leaf damage, environmental conditions, and treatments.  
- Note periods of hot, dry weather that may predict future outbreaks.
