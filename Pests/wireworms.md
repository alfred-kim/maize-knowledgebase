# Wireworms (Agriotes spp.)

**Common name:** Wireworms  
**Scientific name:** *Agriotes* species  
**Importance:** Soil-dwelling larvae; damage maize seeds and seedlings, causing poor germination and stunted growth.

---

## Identification
- Larvae: Hard, slender, yellow-brown to dark brown, 1–5 cm long.  
- Adults: Click beetles, usually brown or black, 1–2 cm long.  
- Larvae are cylindrical, shiny, and segmented.  

---

## Symptoms / Damage
- Seedlings fail to emerge or die shortly after emergence.  
- Holes in seeds and young roots.  
- Stunted growth and poor stand establishment.  
- Damage can be patchy, often in sandy or loamy soils.  

---

## Life cycle (brief)
- Egg → Larva (wireworm stage lasts 2–5 years depending on species) → Pupa → Adult beetle.  
- Larvae feed on seeds, roots, and underground stems.  
- Adults lay eggs in soil; multiple generations over several years.

## Monitoring & Scouting
- Inspect soil for larvae before planting.  
- Use bait traps (e.g., pieces of germinating maize or potato buried in soil) to detect larval presence.  
- Record infestation levels and affected areas for targeted management.

## Integrated Pest Management (IPM)

### Cultural control
- Rotate crops with non-host plants.  
- Avoid planting maize immediately after grasses or cereals.  
- Deep ploughing to expose larvae to predators.  
- Remove crop residues that provide shelter for larvae.

### Biological control
- Entomopathogenic fungi (*Beauveria bassiana*, *Metarhizium anisopliae*) can reduce larval populations.  
- Predatory beetles and ants help control wireworms naturally.

### Chemical control (if necessary)
- Soil-applied insecticides: Chlorpyrifos, Carbofuran (use according to regulations).  
- Target seed or soil treatment before planting.  
- Follow label instructions and wear appropriate PPE.

### Resistance management
- Avoid repeated use of the same chemical class.  
- Combine chemical treatment with cultural and biological measures.

## Safety & environmental notes
- Wear PPE when handling soil insecticides.  
- Avoid contamination of water sources and non-target organisms.  
- Dispose of containers and leftover chemicals according to regulations.

---

## Record keeping
- Track areas planted, infestation levels, and control measures.  
- Helps plan future rotations and reduce wireworm damage.
