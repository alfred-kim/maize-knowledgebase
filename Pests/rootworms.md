# Maize Rootworms (Diabrotica spp.)

**Common name:** Maize rootworms  
**Scientific name:** *Diabrotica* species  
**Importance:** Major soil-dwelling pest; larvae feed on maize roots causing stunted growth, lodging, and yield loss.

---

## Identification
- Larvae: Creamy-white, C-shaped, legless, up to 1 cm long with brown head capsule.  
- Adults: Small beetles, yellowish to brown, sometimes with stripes or spots, ~5–7 mm long.  
- Larvae live in soil feeding on roots; adults feed on silks and leaves.

---

## Symptoms / Damage
- Stunted plants with yellowing leaves.  
- Reduced root mass, root pruning, and poor nutrient/water uptake.  
- Plants may lodge (fall over) due to weak roots.  
- Yield reduction due to poor cob development.  
- Adult feeding on silks may reduce pollination efficiency.

---

## Life cycle (brief)
- Egg → Larva → Pupa → Adult beetle.  
- Larvae develop in soil feeding on roots.  
- Adults emerge, feed on foliage and silks, and lay eggs in soil.  
- One to multiple generations per year depending on species and climate.

---

## Monitoring & Scouting
- Inspect roots for feeding damage and larval presence.  
- Monitor adult beetle populations on leaves and silks during reproductive stage.  
- Record severity of root pruning and percentage of plants affected.

## Integrated Pest Management (IPM)

### Cultural control
- Crop rotation with non-host crops (e.g., legumes) to break pest life cycle.  
- Deep ploughing to expose larvae and pupae to predators.  
- Maintain healthy soil and crop nutrition to reduce impact.

### Biological control
- Entomopathogenic nematodes and fungi can reduce larval populations.  
- Predators: ground beetles and ants feed on larvae in soil.

### Chemical control (if necessary)
- Soil-applied insecticides: Chlorpyrifos, Carbofuran for larvae.  
- Foliar insecticides: Pyrethroids (Cypermethrin, Deltamethrin) for adult beetles.  
- Apply following label instructions and wear PPE.

### Resistance management
- Rotate chemical modes of action.  
- Combine chemical, cultural, and biological methods to reduce resistance development.

## Safety & environmental notes
- Use PPE when handling insecticides.  
- Avoid contamination of water sources and non-target organisms.  
- Dispose of containers and leftover chemicals safely.

---

## Record keeping
- Keep records of larval damage, adult beetle counts, and control measures.  
- Helps plan crop rotation and future pest management strategies.
