# Termites (Macrotermes spp.)

**Common name:** Termites  
**Scientific name:** *Macrotermes* species (common in maize fields)  
**Importance:** Soil-dwelling pests; can damage maize seedlings, stems, and roots, especially in dry areas.

---

## Identification
- Small to medium insects, soft-bodied, light brown to dark brown.  
- Live in large colonies with castes: workers, soldiers, and reproductive individuals.  
- Build soil mounds near fields or galleries in soil and stems.

---

## Symptoms / Damage
- Seedlings cut at the base, causing plant death.  
- Wilting and drying of maize plants.  
- Reduced plant vigor and stunted growth.  
- Soil mounds or tunnels around plant stems.  
- Damage is often patchy but can spread rapidly.

---

## Life cycle (brief)
- Egg → Nymph → Worker/Soldier → Reproductive (queen/king).  
- Colony can survive for many years; queens lay thousands of eggs.  
- Workers feed on cellulose in plant residues and live plants.

---

## Monitoring & Scouting
- Inspect seedlings and stems for signs of cutting and wilting.  
- Check for soil mounds and termite galleries around plants.  
- Note areas with recurring termite activity for targeted management.

## Integrated Pest Management (IPM)

### Cultural control
- Remove crop residues after harvest to reduce food sources.  
- Maintain soil moisture to discourage termite activity.  
- Crop rotation with non-host plants reduces infestation risk.

### Biological control
- Encourage natural predators: ants, birds, and some beetles.  
- Fungal biopesticides (e.g., *Beauveria bassiana*) can be applied to soil in high-infestation areas.

### Chemical control (if necessary)
- Soil treatment with organophosphates: Chlorpyrifos, Diazinon.  
- Phenylpyrazoles: Fipronil for soil application.  
- Apply carefully to avoid environmental contamination; follow label instructions.

### Resistance management
- Use chemicals sparingly and rotate active ingredients to prevent resistance buildup.  
- Combine with cultural and biological methods.

## Safety & environmental notes
- Wear protective equipment when applying chemicals.  
- Avoid contamination of water sources and non-target organisms.  
- Follow recommended application rates and disposal guidelines.

---

## Record keeping
- Track termite-infested areas and treatment history.  
- Helps optimize future management decisions.
