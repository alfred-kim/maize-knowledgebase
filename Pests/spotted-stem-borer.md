# Spotted Stem Borer (Chilo partellus)

**Common name:** Spotted stem borer  
**Scientific name:** *Chilo partellus*  
**Importance:** Major pest of maize and sorghum in Africa; larvae bore into stems causing deadheart and reduced yields.

---

## Identification
- Larvae: Creamy-white to yellowish with dark spots along the body; 2–4 cm when mature.  
- Pupae: Brown, in tunnels within stems or soil.  
- Adults: Moths, pale brown with small dark spots on forewings; wingspan ~2.5–3.5 cm.  

---

## Symptoms / Damage
- Deadheart formation in young plants (central whorl dies).  
- Stem tunneling by larvae weakens plants, causing lodging.  
- Small or malformed cobs in older plants.  
- Frass extrusions visible on stem surface.  
- Damage often concentrated in lower stem and whorl areas.

---

## Life cycle (brief)
- Egg → Larva (5–6 instars) → Pupa → Adult moth.  
- Eggs laid on leaf surfaces; larvae bore into stem within 1–2 days.  
- Multiple generations per year in warm climates.

---

## Monitoring & Scouting
- Inspect 10–20 plants per sample point along a “W” transect.  
- Check for deadhearts, tunneling, and frass.  
- Record percent plants affected and larval stages.

## Integrated Pest Management (IPM)

### Cultural control
- Early planting to avoid peak infestation.  
- Remove crop residues post-harvest to destroy pupae.  
- Push–pull systems using Napier grass and desmodium trap plants.  
- Crop rotation with non-host crops reduces pest pressure.

### Biological control
- Parasitoid wasps (*Cotesia flavipes*) attack larvae.  
- Predators: ants, spiders, birds.  
- Microbial sprays (Bt) effective on young, exposed larvae.

### Chemical control (when necessary)
- Pyrethroids: Cypermethrin, Deltamethrin, Lambda-cyhalothrin.  
- Diamides: Chlorantraniliprole.  
- Target young larvae before they tunnel deeply.  
- Follow label instructions, pre-harvest intervals, and safety measures.

### Resistance management
- Rotate chemical groups to prevent resistance.  
- Combine cultural and biological methods to reduce chemical dependence.

## Safety & environmental notes
- Use PPE when handling insecticides.  
- Avoid spraying near water or sensitive areas.  
- Protect beneficial insects where possible.  
- Follow proper disposal guidelines for containers and leftover sprays.

---

## Record keeping
- Track monitoring data, infestation levels, and control actions.  
- Helps improve future pest management decisions.
