# Leafhoppers (Cicadellidae)

**Common name:** Leafhoppers  
**Scientific names (examples):**  
- Green leafhopper – *Nephotettix virescens*  
- Maize leafhopper – *Cicadulina mbila*  
- Potato leafhopper – *Empoasca fabae*  

**Importance:**  
Sap-sucking pests that damage crops directly by feeding and indirectly by transmitting plant pathogens such as viruses and phytoplasmas (e.g., maize streak virus). Significant pests in cereals, legumes, and vegetables.

## Identification
- **Adults:** Small, wedge-shaped insects; **2–5 mm** long; green, yellow, or brown; highly mobile and jump/fly quickly.  
- **Nymphs:** Similar to adults but wingless and often lighter in color. Move sideways rapidly when disturbed.  
- **Eggs:** Inserted inside leaf tissue, usually along leaf veins.  

---

## Symptoms / Damage
- Leaf yellowing, speckling, or “hopper burn” caused by feeding.  
- Leaf curling, stunting, or reduced vigor.  
- Transmission of phytoplasmas and viruses — often the most serious damage.  
- In maize: stunted plants with striping or mottling (e.g., maize streak virus).  
- High populations can reduce yields significantly.

---

## Life cycle (brief)
- **Egg → Nymph (5 instars) → Adult**.  
- Eggs hatch in 5–10 days depending on temperature.  
- Nymphs feed on underside of leaves.  
- Adults are strong fliers and can migrate over long distances.  
- Multiple generations per year, especially in warm climates.

---

## Monitoring & Scouting
- Inspect underside of leaves for nymphs and adults.  
- Check for yellowing or streaking patterns on young plants.  
- Sweep nets useful for sampling adult populations.  
- Monitor early crop stages closely — young plants are most vulnerable to virus transmission.

## Integrated Pest Management (IPM)

### Cultural control
- Plant tolerant or resistant varieties (especially for maize streak virus).  
- Early planting to avoid peak vector activity.  
- Maintain weed control to reduce alternative hosts.  
- Remove volunteer plants between seasons.

### Biological control
- Predators: spiders, lady beetles, predatory bugs.  
- Parasitoids: small wasps targeting nymphs and eggs.  
- Fungal pathogens (e.g., *Beauveria* spp.) may help in humid conditions.

### Chemical control (if necessary)
- Apply insecticides when leafhopper numbers exceed local thresholds.  
- Effective active ingredients:  
  - Pyrethroids (e.g., lambda-cyhalothrin, deltamethrin)  
  - Neonicotinoids (e.g., imidacloprid, acetamiprid)  
  - Organophosphates (e.g., dimethoate)  
- Apply early in the season to reduce virus transmission.  
- Ensure good coverage of lower leaf surfaces.

### Resistance management
- Rotate insecticide classes to avoid resistance.  
- Avoid excessive spraying — promotes resistance and harms beneficials.  
- Integrate cultural and biological control.

## Safety & environmental notes
- Always use PPE when applying pesticides.  
- Avoid spraying during flowering to protect pollinators.  
- Prevent drift into water bodies.  
- Dispose of used containers safely.

---

## Record keeping
- Track nymph and adult counts, plant symptoms, and inputs used.  
- Record weather conditions — warm, dry periods favor leafhopper outbreaks.
