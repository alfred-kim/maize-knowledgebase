# Corn Root Aphid (Aphis maidiradicis)

**Common name:** Corn root aphid  
**Scientific name:** *Aphis maidiradicis*  

**Importance:**  
Corn root aphids feed on roots and underground stems of maize, sorghum, and some grasses. Their feeding causes stunting, yellowing, poor plant vigor, and reduced yields. They are closely associated with **ant farming behavior**—certain ant species protect and transport aphids to maize roots, increasing infestation severity.

## Identification

### Aphids (nymphs & adults)
- Small, soft-bodied insects; **1–2 mm** long.  
- Colors vary from pale green to bluish-green.  
- Cornicles (rear tubes) are short.  
- Found in clusters on **roots**, root hairs, or at the base of the stem underground.  
- Winged adults (alates) appear when colonies are overcrowded or stressed.

### Ant association
- Ants (especially *Lasius* spp.) often tend the aphids for honeydew.  
- Ant presence around maize hills is a strong indicator of root aphids.

---

## Symptoms / Damage
- Stunted or yellow maize seedlings.  
- Plants may wilt even in moist soil.  
- Poor root development due to sap removal.  
- Patchy growth, uneven plant height, and reduced tillering.  
- Ant mounds or trails around maize plants.  
- Plants may lodge (fall over) in severe infestations.

---

## Life cycle (brief)
- **Egg → Nymph → Adult** (typical aphid development).  
- Eggs overwinter on grasses or in ant chambers.  
- Ants carry newly hatched nymphs to maize roots to begin colonies.  
- Rapid reproduction through parthenogenesis (females giving birth to live young).  
- Several overlapping generations per season.

---

## Monitoring & Scouting
- Look for ant activity around maize bases—dig gently around roots.  
- Inspect roots of weakened or stunted plants.  
- Check for clusters of green aphids on root tissues.  
- Examine grassy weeds near fields (overwintering hosts).  
- Scouting is most important from emergence to V6 (early growth stages).

## Integrated Pest Management (IPM)

### Cultural control
- Rotate crops; avoid continuous maize or sorghum.  
- Control grassy weeds which serve as alternate hosts.  
- Break ant-aphid symbiosis by disturbing ant nests.  
- Plant early to promote strong seedling growth.

### Biological control
- Natural predators (lady beetles, lacewings, hoverflies) help above ground, but limited underground.  
- Parasitic fungi (*Beauveria*, *Metarhizium*) may infect root aphids in moist soils.  
- Predatory ants may suppress pest-associated ant species.

### Chemical control (if necessary)
- Treat seeds with systemic insecticides:  
  - Imidacloprid  
  - Thiamethoxam  
  - Clothianidin  
- Soil drenches or in-furrow applications can help protect seedlings.  
- Target ant populations with bait treatments where allowed.

> Note: Once aphids are established deep on roots, control becomes difficult.

### Resistance management
- Avoid repeated use of neonicotinoids without rotation.  
- Combine chemical, cultural, and ant management strategies.  
- Emphasize weed control and crop rotation.

## Safety & environmental notes
- Use PPE when handling insecticides.  
- Prevent contamination of water sources with treated soil.  
- Ant baits should be used responsibly to avoid harming non-target species.  
- Follow all label instructions for soil-applied products.

---

## Record keeping
- Record ant activity, aphid presence, root damage, and plant performance.  
- Track seed treatments used and their effectiveness.  
- Maintain field history on grassy weed pressure and previous infestations.
