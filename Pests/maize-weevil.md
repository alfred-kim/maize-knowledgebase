# Maize Weevil (Sitophilus zeamais)

**Common name:** Maize weevil  
**Scientific name:** *Sitophilus zeamais*  
**Importance:** Major post-harvest pest of stored maize; can cause severe grain losses if not controlled.

## Identification
- Adult: Small, reddish-brown beetle, ~2–3 mm long, with long snout.  
- Larvae: Creamy-white, legless, develop inside kernels.  
- Eggs are laid inside maize kernels; adults emerge by chewing exit holes.  

---

## Symptoms / Damage
- Small round holes on maize kernels.  
- Powdery dust (frass) inside storage containers.  
- Reduced weight and quality of stored maize.  
- Secondary fungal infection risk increases due to damaged kernels.  
- Infested grains may have a distinct odor.

---

## Life cycle (brief)
- Egg → Larva → Pupa → Adult.  
- Development time depends on temperature and moisture (typically 4–6 weeks under favorable conditions).  
- Can reproduce year-round in warm, humid conditions.

---

## Monitoring & Scouting
- Regularly inspect stored maize for adult beetles and frass.  
- Shake small samples of grain to detect movement or audible beetles.  
- Check moisture content; maize with moisture >12% is more susceptible.

## Integrated Pest Management (IPM)

### Cultural control
- Dry maize thoroughly before storage (moisture <12%).  
- Clean storage facilities before new maize is stored.  
- Rotate and remove old grains.  
- Store maize in sealed containers or hermetic bags.

### Biological control
- Limited biological options; entomopathogenic fungi (*Beauveria bassiana*) may reduce weevil populations.

### Chemical control (if necessary)
- Fumigation with phosphine (PH₃) or controlled insecticides for stored grain.  
- Dusts such as diatomaceous earth or approved grain protectants.  
- Follow safety precautions and label instructions.

---

## Safety & environmental notes
- Use protective equipment when handling fumigants or insecticides.  
- Ensure proper ventilation during chemical treatments.  
- Avoid contamination of food intended for immediate consumption.

---

## Record keeping
- Track storage duration, infestation levels, and treatments applied.  
- Helps plan future storage and pest management strategies.
