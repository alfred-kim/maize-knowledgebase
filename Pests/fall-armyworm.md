# Fall Armyworm (Spodoptera frugiperda)

**Common name:** Fall armyworm (FAW)  
**Scientific name:** *Spodoptera frugiperda*  
**Importance:** Major maize pest worldwide; rapid spread, high damage potential.

## Identification
- Larvae (caterpillars): 1–5 cm long when mature; coloration variable (green, brown, black) with longitudinal stripes. Younger larvae often have an inverted “Y” marking on the head capsule.  
- Pupae: brown, in the soil.  
- Adult moths: grey-brown moths, nocturnal, attracted to light.

---

## Symptoms / Damage
- Irregular holes and ragged feeding on leaf margins and within leaf whorls.  
- “Windowpane” feeding on young leaves (transparent patches).  
- Frass (dark granular droppings) inside the whorl.  
- Severe infestations: tassel and cob damage, reduced kernel set and yield loss.  
- Damage can appear suddenly and escalate quickly.

---

## Life cycle (brief)
- Egg → Larva (6 instars) → Pupa → Adult moth.  
- Development time depends on temperature; several generations per year possible in warm climates.

---

## Monitoring & Scouting
- Walk a “W” transect across the field and inspect plants at regular intervals.  
- Inspect 10–20 plants at each of 10 sample points (or a sampling intensity appropriate to field size).  
- Check the whorl and underside of leaves for larvae and frass.  
- Record percent plants infested and larval sizes (small larvae cause less damage than large larvae).  
- Use pheromone traps to monitor adult moth activity (useful for early warning).

## Economic threshold (guidance)
> Thresholds vary by region, crop stage and available control method. Always follow local extension recommendations.

Typical practical guidance used in many areas:  
- Consider action if a significant proportion of plants (e.g., ~20% or more) show active feeding by small larvae, or if large larvae are already present and crop is at a vulnerable stage.  
- For late vegetative/early reproductive stages, lower thresholds may apply because damage to cobs causes higher economic loss.

## Integrated Pest Management (IPM)
Emphasize multiple tactics to reduce reliance on chemicals and delay resistance.

### Cultural control
- Early planting to avoid peak pest pressure.  
- Destroy crop residues after harvest to reduce overwintering/pupae survival.  
- Intercropping and push–pull systems can reduce infestation levels.  
- Maintain healthy crop nutrition — stressed plants are more vulnerable.

### Biological control
- Encourage natural enemies: parasitoids (e.g., *Trichogramma*, *Cotesia* spp.), predators (ladybirds, spiders).  
- Use microbial biopesticides where appropriate: *Bacillus thuringiensis* (Bt) formulations targeted at lepidopteran larvae.  
- Entomopathogenic fungi (e.g., *Beauveria bassiana*) and entomopathogenic nematodes can help in some settings.

### Chemical control (when necessary)
- Use selective insecticides targeting early larval stages for best efficacy. Common active ingredients used against FAW include:  
  - Chlorantraniliprole (diamide)  
  - Emamectin benzoate (avermectin)  
  - Lambda-cyhalothrin, cypermethrin, deltamethrin (pyrethroids) — note varying efficacy and resistance concerns  
- **Important:** Always follow the product label, local regulations and extension recommendations. Observe pre-harvest intervals (PHI) and wear appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE). Avoid off-label dosages.

### Resistance management
- Rotate insecticide modes of action (MOA) to reduce selection pressure.  
- Avoid repeated uses of the same active ingredient or MOA within and across seasons.  
- Integrate non-chemical measures (biological + cultural) to reduce reliance on pesticides.

## Application timing & technique (practical tips)
- Target young larvae (1st–3rd instars) for better control; once larvae bore into whorl or stems control becomes harder.  
- Ensure good spray coverage — spray into the whorl and leaf axils. Use appropriate nozzle and water volume recommended on the label.  
- Avoid spraying during hot midday hours and during windy conditions.

---

## Safety & environmental notes
- Minimize impact on beneficial insects by using targeted, low-toxicity options when possible.  
- Use PPE (gloves, mask, long sleeves) when handling and applying insecticides.  
- Follow disposal instructions for containers and leftover spray solution.  
- Consider nearby pollinator resources and aquatic ecosystems when choosing and applying products.

---

## Record keeping
- Keep records of monitoring data (dates, infestation levels), products used (active ingredient, rate, date), and observed efficacy. This helps inform later management decisions and resistance tracking.
