# African Maize Stem Borer (Busseola fusca)

**Common name:** African maize stem borer  
**Scientific name:** *Busseola fusca*  
**Importance:** One of the most destructive maize pests in Africa; larvae bore into stems causing deadheart and reduced yields.

## Identification
- Larvae: Creamy-white to light brown with a dark head capsule; 2–5 cm when mature.  
- Pupae: Brown, in the soil at the base of plants.  
- Adults: Moths, grey-brown, nocturnal, wingspan ~3–4 cm.  

---

## Symptoms / Damage
- Deadheart formation in young maize (central whorl dies).  
- Stem tunneling by larvae, weakening plants.  
- Reduced cob formation and poor kernel set.  
- Broken or lodging stems under wind or rain.  
- Damage often starts in the lower parts of the plant.

---

## Life cycle (brief)
- Egg → Larva (6 instars) → Pupa → Adult moth.  
- Eggs laid on leaves near the whorl; larvae bore into stems shortly after hatching.  
- Multiple generations possible per year depending on climate.

---

## Monitoring & Scouting
- Inspect 10–20 plants per sample point along a “W” transect.  
- Look for deadhearts, stem holes, frass extrusions.  
- Record percent plants affected and larval stage.

## Integrated Pest Management (IPM)
A combination of cultural, biological, and chemical control is recommended.

### Cultural control
- Destroy crop residues after harvest to remove overwintering pupae.  
- Early planting to avoid peak pest activity.  
- Push–pull systems (intercropping with trap plants like Napier grass and desmodium).  
- Crop rotation with non-host crops.

### Biological control
- Parasitoid wasps (*Cotesia flavipes*) attack larvae.  
- Predators: ants, spiders, and birds.  
- Microbial control (Bt sprays) may be effective on exposed larvae.

### Chemical control (if necessary)
- Pyrethroids: Cypermethrin, Deltamethrin, Lambda-cyhalothrin.  
- Diamides: Chlorantraniliprole.  
- Apply targeting young larvae before they tunnel deep into stems.  
- Follow label instructions, PHI, and safety precautions.

### Resistance management
- Rotate chemical groups to avoid resistance buildup.  
- Integrate cultural and biological methods to reduce chemical dependence.

## Safety & environmental notes
- Use personal protective equipment (PPE) when handling insecticides.  
- Avoid spraying near water sources.  
- Follow disposal instructions for containers and leftover solutions.  
- Protect beneficial insects where possible.

---

## Record keeping
- Keep track of monitoring, infestation levels, and control measures.  
- Helps inform future planting decisions and IPM improvements.
