# Chafer Beetles (Scarabaeidae)

**Common name:** Chafer beetles / White grubs  
**Scientific names (examples):**  
- *Melolontha spp.* – European chafer  
- *Phyllophaga spp.* – May/June beetles  
- *Oryctes spp.* – Rhinoceros beetles (related scarab pests)  
- *Holotrichia spp.* – Common chafers in Africa and Asia  

**Importance:**  
Chafer beetle larvae (white grubs) are major soil pests that attack maize, sugarcane, sorghum, vegetables, and pasture grasses. They feed on roots, reducing plant vigor, causing wilting, and often killing young plants. Adults of some species feed on foliage but larval root-feeding causes the most economic damage.

## Identification

### Larvae (white grubs)
- C-shaped, creamy white grubs with a brown head capsule.  
- Three pairs of well-developed thoracic legs.  
- Length **10–40 mm** depending on species and instar.  
- Soil-dwelling and often found around plant roots.

### Adults
- Robust, oval-shaped beetles, usually **10–25 mm** long.  
- Colors range from brown to black or reddish.  
- Active at night; attracted to lights.  
- Some species feed on leaves or flowers.

### Eggs
- Small, white, spherical eggs laid in soil in clusters.

## Symptoms / Damage
- Patchy wilting or yellowing of young maize plants.  
- Plants easily pulled from the ground due to destroyed roots.  
- Poor emergence or missing plants in rows.  
- Stunting and reduced tillering in cereals.  
- In severe cases, complete plant death.  
- Sandy or light soils are more prone to severe grub damage.

---

## Life cycle (brief)
- **Egg → Larva (3 instars) → Pupa → Adult**.  
- Eggs hatch in 1–3 weeks depending on species.  
- Larval stage lasts **several months**, causing most of the damage.  
- Pupation occurs in the soil.  
- Adults emerge seasonally, often with rains.  
- Many species have **one generation per year**, though some take 2–3 years.

## Monitoring & Scouting
- Inspect soil around wilted or stunted plants for white grubs.  
- Dig 15–20 cm deep to check for larvae near roots.  
- Monitor for adult beetle flights using light traps.  
- Examine weedy or grassy field margins, which serve as breeding sites.  
- Higher risk in fields previously under pasture or grass cover.

## Integrated Pest Management (IPM)

### Cultural control
- Deep ploughing exposes larvae and pupae to birds and sunlight.  
- Crop rotation with non-host crops.  
- Avoid planting maize immediately after pasture or fallow.  
- Maintain weed and grass control around fields.  
- Good soil fertility and moisture help plants tolerate damage.

### Biological control
- Entomopathogenic fungi: *Metarhizium anisopliae*, *Beauveria bassiana*.  
- Entomopathogenic nematodes: *Heterorhabditis* and *Steinernema* spp. (effective against larvae).  
- Predators: birds, ground beetles, ants, and parasitic wasps.

### Chemical control (if necessary)
- Soil-applied insecticides during planting can reduce damage:  
  - Chlorantraniliprole (soil formulation)  
  - Imidacloprid (seed treatment or soil drench)  
  - Thiamethoxam (seed treatment)  
- Apply at planting to protect seedlings during early growth.  
- Spot treatment in heavily infested areas may be sufficient.  

### Resistance management
- Avoid repeated use of neonicotinoids alone.  
- Integrate chemical methods with crop rotation and biological control.  
- Use threshold-based applications.

## Safety & environmental notes
- Follow PPE guidelines when handling soil insecticides.  
- Avoid contamination of water bodies with treated soil.  
- Neonicotinoids can affect beneficial insects—use cautiously and only when necessary.  
- Dispose of chemical containers safely.

---

## Record keeping
- Record grub counts per sampling pit.  
- Note areas of chronic infestation and crop history.  
- Track planting dates, insecticide applications, and field performance.
