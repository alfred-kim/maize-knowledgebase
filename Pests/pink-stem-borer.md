# Pink Stem Borer (Sesamia calamistis)

**Common name:** Pink stem borer  
**Scientific name:** *Sesamia calamistis*  
**Importance:** Major maize pest in Africa; larvae bore into stems, causing deadheart and yield loss.

---

## Identification
- Larvae: Pinkish to light brown, 2–4 cm long when mature; soft-bodied with faint longitudinal stripes.  
- Pupae: Brown, found in the soil or inside stem tunnels.  
- Adults: Moths, light brown with pale forewings, wingspan ~3–4 cm; nocturnal.

---

## Symptoms / Damage
- Deadheart formation in young maize plants.  
- Stem tunneling by larvae weakens the plant and can cause lodging.  
- Reduced cob size and poor kernel set.  
- Frass extrusions visible at stem holes.  
- Damage usually concentrated at the base of stems but may extend upward in older plants.

---

## Life cycle (brief)
- Egg → Larva (6 instars) → Pupa → Adult moth.  
- Eggs laid on leaf surfaces near the whorl; larvae bore into the stem within 1–2 days.  
- Multiple generations per year depending on climate and crop season.

---

## Monitoring & Scouting
- Inspect 10–20 plants per sample point along a “W” transect.  
- Look for deadhearts, frass extrusions, and tunneling.  
- Record percentage of plants infested and larval stages to inform management decisions.

## Integrated Pest Management (IPM)

### Cultural control
- Early planting to avoid peak pest pressure.  
- Remove crop residues after harvest to destroy pupae.  
- Intercropping and push–pull systems (Napier grass, desmodium) reduce infestation.  
- Rotate crops with non-host species.

### Biological control
- Parasitoid wasps (*Cotesia flavipes*) attack larvae.  
- Predators: ants, spiders, birds.  
- Microbial biopesticides: *Bacillus thuringiensis* (Bt) sprays effective on exposed larvae.

### Chemical control (if necessary)
- Pyrethroids: Cypermethrin, Deltamethrin, Lambda-cyhalothrin.  
- Diamides: Chlorantraniliprole.  
- Apply targeting young larvae before they bore deeply into stems.  
- Always follow product label, pre-harvest intervals (PHI), and wear PPE.

### Resistance management
- Rotate insecticide modes of action (MOA) to delay resistance.  
- Combine cultural and biological methods to reduce chemical reliance.

## Safety & environmental notes
- Use personal protective equipment when applying chemicals.  
- Avoid contamination of water sources and sensitive areas.  
- Protect beneficial insects wherever possible.  
- Properly dispose of containers and leftover sprays.

---

## Record keeping
- Maintain logs of monitoring, infestation levels, and control measures.  
- Helps optimize future pest management strategies.
