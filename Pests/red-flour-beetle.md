# Red Flour Beetle (Tribolium castaneum)

**Common name:** Red flour beetle  
**Scientific name:** *Tribolium castaneum*  
**Importance:** Major stored-product pest; infests flour, maize meal, grains, bran, and other processed products. Causes contamination, quality loss, and promotes mold growth.

---

## Identification
- **Adults:** Flat, elongated, reddish-brown beetles; **3–4 mm** long; able to fly in warm conditions.  
- **Larvae:** Creamy-yellow, slender, worm-like with a darker head; up to **6 mm** long.  
- **Pupae:** Pale, immobile, found among grain residues or processed products.  
- Adults emit a characteristic odor when present in large numbers.

---

## Symptoms / Damage
- Contamination of flour and stored products with adults, larvae, frass, and cast skins.  
- Heating and moisture buildup in infested products can lead to mold growth.  
- Off-odors and discoloration reduce marketability.  
- Cannot damage whole, intact grain but thrives in broken grain, flour, and residues.

---

## Life cycle (brief)
- **Egg → Larva → Pupa → Adult**.  
- Eggs laid loosely in flour or grain dust.  
- Larvae develop feeding on finely milled products.  
- Development takes **25–50 days** depending on temperature and humidity.  
- Multiple overlapping generations occur year-round in storage.

---

## Monitoring & Scouting
- Inspect flour, maize meal, bran, and store corners for live adults and larvae.  
- Use **pitfall traps** or food-baited traps to monitor adult activity.  
- Check cracks, equipment seams, and storage bins for residues that support breeding.  
- Track product temperature and humidity.

## Integrated Pest Management (IPM)

### Cultural control
- Maintain strict sanitation: remove dust, residues, and spilled grain.  
- Clean machinery, mill floors, storage bins, and bag stacks regularly.  
- Use FIFO (first-in, first-out) storage rotation.  
- Keep storage areas dry and cool.

### Biological control
- Natural predators (tiny parasitoids and mites) may exist but are generally not sufficient for control.  
- Limit unnecessary chemical use to preserve beneficial organisms.

### Chemical control (if necessary)
- **Contact insecticides** approved for storage structures (e.g., pyrethroids) applied to empty stores before loading grain.  
- **Fumigation** (phosphine) for heavily infested stored products — trained personnel only.  
- Avoid contamination of food meant for direct consumption; apply only labeled treatments.

### Resistance management
- *T. castaneum* is known for fumigant and insecticide resistance.  
- Rotate chemical classes and avoid repeated use of the same active ingredient.  
- Prioritize sanitation + structural treatments over product treatments.

---

## Safety & environmental notes
- Wear appropriate PPE when handling insecticides or fumigants.  
- Ensure good ventilation during fumigation.  
- Keep chemicals away from food, water, and living areas.  
- Dispose of containers responsibly following regulations.

---

## Record keeping
- Document infestation levels, trap counts, cleaning schedules, and treatments applied.  
- Helps identify hotspots and refine future management strategies.
