# Armyworms (Spodoptera spp. & Mythimna spp.)

**Common name:** Armyworms  
**Scientific names:**  
- African armyworm – *Spodoptera exempta*  
- Beet armyworm – *Spodoptera exigua*  
- True/native armyworm – *Mythimna unipuncta*  
**Importance:** Major defoliators of maize and other cereals; large outbreaks can cause rapid and severe leaf loss, damaging early and mid-stage crops.

## Identification
- **Larvae:** Smooth-bodied caterpillars; green, brown, or black; length **up to 35–40 mm** depending on species.  
  - *Spodoptera* spp. often show stripes along the body.  
  - *M. unipuncta* has pale stripes and a smooth appearance.  
- **Adults:** Brown or gray moths with a wingspan of **25–35 mm**.  
- Caterpillars feed mostly at night and hide in soil or leaf litter during the day.

## Symptoms / Damage
- Ragged leaf edges, large holes, or complete defoliation.  
- Windowpane feeding on early instars.  
- Rapid damage — caterpillars move in large groups “like an army.”  
- Feeding on whorls and young cobs in heavy infestations.  
- Can destroy entire seedling stands overnight.

---

## Life cycle (brief)
- **Egg → Larva → Pupa → Adult**.  
- Eggs laid in clusters on leaves or vegetation near fields.  
- Larvae feed for 2–3 weeks before pupating in soil.  
- Adults emerge and disperse widely.  
- Several generations per year, with outbreaks driven by rainfall and temperature.

---

## Monitoring & Scouting
- Begin scouting immediately after crop emergence.  
- Look for egg masses on lower leaves and grass weeds.  
- Inspect field edges — infestations often begin there.  
- Check early morning or evening when larvae are active.  
- Pheromone traps help monitor adult moth flights.

## Integrated Pest Management (IPM)

### Cultural control
- Early planting to avoid peak armyworm outbreaks.  
- Maintain good weed control, especially grasses.  
- Encourage birds and natural predators by reducing unnecessary pesticide use.  
- Flooding fields (where applicable) can kill young larvae.

### Biological control
- Natural enemies include parasitoid wasps (*Cotesia*, *Chelonus* spp.), ground beetles, birds, and viruses like *Spodoptera* NPV.  
- Commercial NPV formulations effective against *S. exempta* and *S. exigua*.  
- *Bacillus thuringiensis* (Bt) products effective on small larvae.

### Chemical control (if necessary)
- Apply insecticides when **larvae are small (1st–3rd instars)** for best results.  
- Effective active ingredients:  
  - Pyrethroids (e.g., cypermethrin, deltamethrin)  
  - Carbamates (e.g., carbaryl)  
  - Organophosphates (e.g., chlorpyrifos)  
  - Spinosyns (e.g., spinosad)  
- Ensure thorough coverage of whorls and leaf surfaces.  
- Always follow label instructions and wear PPE.

### Resistance management
- Rotate insecticides with different **modes of action**.  
- Avoid repeated use of pyrethroids alone.  
- Combine chemical, biological, and cultural measures.

## Safety & environmental notes
- Wear PPE when applying pesticides.  
- Avoid drift into water bodies or livestock areas.  
- Do not spray during windy conditions.  
- Dispose of containers safely.

---

## Record keeping
- Track moth trap counts, larval density, damaged plants, and treatments.  
- Helps predict future outbreaks and refine IPM strategies.
