# Aphids (Rhopalosiphum maidis)

**Common name:** Corn aphid or maize aphid  
**Scientific name:** *Rhopalosiphum maidis*  
**Importance:** Major sap-sucking pest of maize; can cause stunted growth and transmit viral diseases.

## Identification
- Small, soft-bodied insects, 1–3 mm long.  
- Color: green to yellow, sometimes black.  
- Found on the underside of leaves, whorls, or young shoots.  
- Produce sticky honeydew which can promote sooty mold growth.

---

## Symptoms / Damage
- Stunted growth and distorted leaves.  
- Curling or rolling of young leaves.  
- Yellowing and wilting of plants in severe infestations.  
- Honeydew deposition leading to sooty mold on leaves.  
- Vector for maize viruses (e.g., Maize dwarf mosaic virus).

---

## Life cycle (brief)
- Reproduce rapidly through parthenogenesis (asexual reproduction).  
- Winged forms can migrate to other plants when populations are high.  
- Multiple generations per season; population can explode under warm, humid conditions.

---

## Monitoring & Scouting
- Inspect the underside of leaves and whorls for aphids.  
- Record the number of aphids per plant or per leaf.  
- Monitor for signs of honeydew or leaf distortion.

## Integrated Pest Management (IPM)

### Cultural control
- Remove and destroy crop residues to reduce overwintering sites.  
- Use resistant maize varieties where available.  
- Encourage plant diversity and natural predator habitats.

### Biological control
- Predators: ladybirds (ladybugs), lacewings, spiders.  
- Parasitoids: *Aphidius* spp.  
- Encourage natural enemies rather than broad-spectrum insecticides.

### Chemical control (if necessary)
- Neonicotinoids: Imidacloprid, Thiamethoxam  
- Pyrethroids: Cypermethrin, Deltamethrin  
- Apply only when populations exceed economic thresholds.  
- Follow label instructions, PHI, and wear PPE.

### Resistance management
- Rotate insecticide modes of action (MOA) to prevent resistance.  
- Combine chemical treatment with cultural and biological controls.

---

## Safety & environmental notes
- Wear PPE when handling insecticides.  
- Avoid spraying near water sources and pollinator habitats.  
- Dispose of containers and leftovers according to local regulations.

---

## Record keeping
- Maintain logs of aphid populations, infested plants, and treatments applied.  
- Helps track trends and inform future management decisions.
