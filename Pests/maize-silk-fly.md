# Maize Silk Fly (Atherigona spp.)

**Common name:** Maize silk fly / Maize leaf miner fly  
**Scientific names (examples):**  
- *Atherigona soccata* – Sorghum shoot fly (also attacks maize seedlings)  
- *Atherigona orientalis* – Maize silk fly (common in East Africa)  
- *Atherigona spp.* – Several species affecting cereals  

**Importance:**  
Silk flies attack maize during silking, feeding on silks and ovipositing in the ear, which results in poor kernel set, malformed cobs, and increased risk of fungal infection. They are increasingly recognized as important pests in African smallholder maize systems.

## Identification
- **Adults:**  
  - Small grayish flies, **3–5 mm** long.  
  - Slender body with dark stripes on the thorax.  
  - Resemble small houseflies.  

- **Larvae (maggots):**  
  - Creamy white, cylindrical, legless.  
  - Found inside **silks** or the **ear tip** feeding on plant tissues.  

- **Eggs:**  
  - Tiny, white, elongated eggs laid on fresh maize silks.

## Symptoms / Damage
- Feeding damage on **fresh maize silks**, causing:  
  - Reduced pollination  
  - Poor grain filling  
  - Irregular or partially filled cobs  
- Larvae bore into silks and ear tips.  
- Presence of small maggots inside silks or cob tips.  
- Early damage resembles earworm injury but without large holes or frass.  
- Increased susceptibility to **molds** entering through feeding wounds.

---

## Life cycle (brief)
- **Egg → Larva → Pupa → Adult**.  
- Eggs hatch within 1–3 days.  
- Larval feeding continues for 5–10 days in silks and ear tips.  
- Pupation occurs in soil or within the damaged silks.  
- Multiple generations per year, with populations peaking during warm, humid periods.

---

## Monitoring & Scouting
- Inspect fields **during tasseling and silking**, when risk is highest.  
- Look for:  
  - Adult flies resting on leaves or tassels  
  - Eggs on fresh, green silks  
  - Maggots inside silks or ear tips  
- Sample 10–20 plants per field section.  
- Fields with poor pollination or silks drying prematurely should be examined for silk fly damage.

## Integrated Pest Management (IPM)

### Cultural control
- Plant early to avoid peak fly populations.  
- Synchronize planting across farms to reduce prolonged silk availability.  
- Remove crop residues to reduce breeding sites.  
- Maintain good field sanitation and destroy infested cobs after harvest.

### Biological control
- Parasitoid wasps that attack *Atherigona* eggs and larvae (depending on region).  
- Predators such as spiders and ground beetles help suppress adults.  
- Entomopathogenic fungi (*Metarhizium*, *Beauveria*) may reduce adult fly populations in moist conditions.

### Chemical control (if necessary)
- Sprays are most effective **early**, when eggs and small larvae are present on silks.  
- Use insecticides that target adult flies or early larvae:  
  - Pyrethroids (cypermethrin, lambda-cyhalothrin)  
  - Spinosyns (spinosad)  
  - Diamides (chlorantraniliprole)  
- Direct sprays to **silks and ear zone**.  
- Avoid spraying during peak pollinator activity (mid-morning).  

### Resistance management
- Rotate between insecticides with different **modes of action**.  
- Combine chemical control with cultural practices.  
- Avoid unnecessary spraying when populations are low.

## Safety & environmental notes
- Wear PPE when handling insecticides.  
- Avoid drift onto bee habitats — silking maize attracts pollinators.  
- Dispose of containers properly.  
- Do not spray under windy conditions.

---

## Record keeping
- Note adult fly activity, silk infestation levels, and resulting cob damage.  
- Track planting dates, silk emergence, and treatment timing.
